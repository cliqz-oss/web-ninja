# Contributing to 'Web Ninja'

Thank you for taking the time to contribute! We are excited to welcome contributors and we really value the time you take to work with us on this project.

*Web Ninja* is meant to provide solutions :

An educational game to illustrate issues of tracking and centralisation on the web.

You are tasked with finding information on the web, but you are being tracked - if your adversaries find what you are doing, you lose. Based on the requests going out of your browser the game will show what information is being leaked, and to whom. Different trackers can be included to ramp up difficultly.

Who's looking for you?

 * Google: Searches + Ad network and GA tracker - makes ~60% of the web unusable
 * Facebook: Another 25% of the web - cookie tracking reveals your name
 * Twitter
 * Microsoft: Bing search + other trackers
 * Amazon: Include AWS resources?

How do you get found?

 * IP Address
 * Signin cookies for above services
 * Revealing urls sent to trackers (e.g. Maps urls reveal what you're searching for, search for train tickets/flights put params in the url)

## What we're working on

The project is still at an early stage, which means there are a lot of opportunities to contribute in a meaningful way. To ease the onboarding process, we have gathered and created issues in our issue tracker. Please take a look at the [opened issues](https://github.com/cliqz-oss/web-ninja/issues).


## How to submit changes

Once you've identified one of the issues above that you feel you can contribute to, you're ready to make a change to the project repository!

1. **Notify others by commenting on the issue**. By commenting on the issue, you
   will initiate a discussion around possible solutions and also communicate to
   other contributors that you started working on it. This will avoid having
   several people starting working on the same thing.
2. **[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository**. This makes your own version of this project you can edit and use.
3. **[Make your changes](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-changes)**! You can do this in the GitHub interface on your own local machine (we *strongly recommend that you create a new branch* to make your changes). Once you're happy with your changes...
4. **Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/)**. This opens a discussion around your project and lets the project lead know you are proposing changes.

## How to report bugs

Bugs are everywhere, and we would love it if you could be on the lookout for them, and raise an [issue](https://github.com/cliqz-oss/privacy-bot/issues) if you find one. Bugs can be anywhere:

* Conceptual design,
* Code,
* Spelling or formatting,
* or anything else we haven't yet thought of.

If you notice a bug, please raise an issue and label it with the label `bug`. Then anyone in community can get right on it, and everything gets fixed faster.
