## Web Ninja

An educational game to illustrate issues of tracking and centralisation on the web.

### Description

You are tasked with finding information on the web, but you are being tracked - if your adversaries find what you are doing, you lose. Based on the requests going out of your browser the game will show what information is being leaked, and to whom. Different trackers can be included to ramp up difficultly.

Who's looking for you?

 * Google: Searches + Ad network and GA tracker - makes ~60% of the web unusable
 * Facebook: Another 25% of the web - cookie tracking reveals your name
 * Twitter
 * Microsoft: Bing search + other trackers
 * Amazon: Include AWS resources?

How do you get found?

 * IP Address
 * Signin cookies for above services
 * Revealing urls sent to trackers (e.g. Maps urls reveal what you're searching for, search for train tickets/flights put params in the url)
